description: Use when the user asks to fix a specific GitHub issue in this repository. Runs the squad pipeline — Lead plans and picks a tier, the Devil's Advocate challenges the plan, Security reviews plan and diff of security-tier changes, Tester writes failing tests first, Dev implements until the Coverage gate passes, Code Officer clears format and analyzer findings, Reviewer reviews, the PR is approved by checklist with the Lead deciding what is open — and opens a PR referencing the issue.

# Squad Issue

Fix a reported GitHub issue with the squad defined in `.squad/`. You are the **orchestrator**: you launch
the members as subagents, pass their outputs on (they cannot talk to each other), enforce the tiers and
loop limits from [`.squad/routing.md`](../../../.squad/routing.md), and perform every Git and GitHub
action yourself — including follow-up issues the Lead decides on.

- **You never do a member's work.** You do not edit production code, tests or documentation the plan
  assigns to the Dev, do not run the formatter, and do not fix analyzer findings. Whatever a check of yours
  finds goes to its owner (production code → `squad-dev`, tests → `squad-tester`, formatting/analyzer-only
  edits → `squad-code-officer`) and through the steps that follow it. Besides read-only checks (`--check`,
  the gate scripts, tests) you only write the squad's bookkeeping: `log.md` (through
  `python3 .squad/tools/squad-log.py`) and `tasks.md` check marks (features). The one exception is tier
  `docs`: there you apply the Lead's exact edits yourself (`.squad/routing.md`, *Tiers*).
- **Hand each member only what it needs.** The plan (for a feature: its task rows), the test names, the
  base ref and the gate output for the head. Not the log, not the issue thread (the Lead and the Devil's
  Advocate read the issue themselves), not earlier reports in full — one line on what the previous member
  handed back is enough. Every launch starts with an empty context, so what you pass is what it costs.
- **The squad does not change itself in a product PR.** An issue or feature PR never touches `.squad/`
  (`team.md`, `routing.md`, tools), `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md`. Lessons about the squad are filed in step 12 as `.squad/routing.md`,
  *Squad lessons*, says — template-managed files in the template repository, project knowledge here. If the
  change itself genuinely needs one of those files (e.g. a new build command every contributor must know),
  the Lead escalates instead and the Product Manager decides: `.squad/stack.md` and `.squad/project.md` may
  change in the product PR (*Scope of a product PR*); a template-managed file is changed in the template
  repository; any other squad or instruction file (e.g. a project block) goes into a separate
  squad-maintenance PR.
- **Working records stay off `main`.** `specs/<folder>/` exists only on the work branch, so it survives a
  crashed session. Before the PR (step 10) its content is posted as a comment and the folder is removed;
  the lasting reasoning lives in `docs/decisions/`.
- **One build at a time.** Never run two members that build or test (`squad-dev`, `squad-tester`,
  `squad-code-officer`, the reviewers' verification runs) in parallel: they share `bin/` and `obj/` and
  break each other (`.squad/routing.md`). Launch them one after another; only `squad-reviewer` and
  `squad-security` may run together in step 8, because both are read-only and the reviewer's own build
  happens in a scratch copy.
- **Commits and pushes** to the work branch are always allowed (`CLAUDE.md`, golden rules): commit and
  push `specs/<folder>/log.md` right after intake (step 1), so a stop hook or a crashed session finds no
  untracked files, and after every further completed step. PRs are merged with *Squash and merge*, so only
  the PR title and description reach `main`; intermediate commit messages may name the step, but never
  contain secrets. Interim work-in-progress commits — e.g. demanded by a stop hook while a member is still
  working — are fine for the same reason; the commit that closes the round gets a final subject. Before the
  PR they cost nothing; after it (step 11) every push re-triggers CI and code analysis, so batch the
  edits of a round and commit them once. Stage with plain `git add -A`: ignored paths such as `TestResults/`
  are skipped anyway, and an exclusion pathspec for an ignored path makes `git add` fail and stage
  nothing. Never commit to `main`.
- **GitHub access:** use the GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`) for issues, comments, labels and pull
  requests. In these sessions the `gh` CLI only works as `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/...`; `gh issue`,
  `gh pr` and `gh search` fail (GraphQL is blocked and search is not scoped to the repository).
- **Pull request:** invoking this skill is the user's approval for opening the PR in step 10, once the
  Lead has approved it (tier `docs`: once the latest review round is clean).
- **Product Manager:** the user is only contacted when the Lead returns `RESULT: ESCALATE` (relay the
  question verbatim with its options and wait) or for confirming a public issue comment on
  `RESULT: NO CHANGE`.
- Everything that ends up in the repository or on GitHub is written in **English**.

## Steps

1. **Intake.** Read the issue in full, including comments; note the reported environment (versions of the
   software involved, image tag or release, host OS, configuration). If it is closed, stop and report that. Start
   from a clean working tree on a new branch off the latest `main`, e.g.
   `fix-issue-<number>-<short-slug>` (or the branch the session prescribes). Create
   `specs/issue-<number>/log.md` from `specs/_template/log.md`, commit and push it. Only you (the
   orchestrator) write `log.md`, one row per step, always with
   `python3 .squad/tools/squad-log.py issue-<number> "<step>" "<member>" "<result>"` — it keeps the line
   ending, escapes pipes and control characters, and dates the row. For a subagent launch add what the usage
   block at the end of the launch result reports: `--launch <model>/<effort> --tokens <subagent_tokens>
   --tool-uses <tool_uses> --seconds <duration_ms / 1000>`, with the model and effort from the agent file (or
   the launch's own override); the wrap-up sums it per role. After every member's report, commit and
   push the files it left in the work folder (the Lead's records, the Tester's tests) yourself, so the next
   report does not list them as untracked noise.
2. **Plan.** Launch `squad-lead` in mode `plan` with the issue text and the work folder. It returns one of:
   - `RESULT: DONE` — for tier **`docs`** (definition in `.squad/routing.md`), a short result (tier, the
     exact edits, acceptance criteria) that you record as the first plan row in `log.md`; apply the edits
     yourself, run `python3 .squad/tools/scope-check.py --tier docs` and *Format check*, then one review
     round in step 8 and step 10 directly — no Security, skeleton, tests, coverage, Code Officer or Lead
     approval. Otherwise:
     `plan.md` with the **tier** (`trivial` / `standard` / `security`), acceptance
     criteria, the signatures of new or changed API, the affected area documents (`docs/areas/`), required documentation updates (`README.md`,
     `docs/`), and `Proposed` decision records. Continue with the steps the tier requires.
   - `RESULT: NO CHANGE` — show the proposed issue comment to the user, post it only after confirmation
     (append the log as a collapsed "Squad working record" block), remove the work folder with a commit
     and push, and stop. No PR; the branch stays as it is, and you tell the user so.
   - `RESULT: ESCALATE` — ask the user, then relaunch the Lead with the answer.

   **Plan challenge** (`standard` and `security` only, once). Launch `squad-devils-advocate` with the issue
   text and the work folder. On `VERDICT: OBJECTIONS …`, launch `squad-lead` in mode `revise` with the
   objections; it answers each one in the plan's *Challenge* section (accepted and the plan revised, or
   rejected with a reason) and may narrow the scope, raise the tier or switch to `RESULT: NO CHANGE`.
   `RESULT: NO CHANGE` and `RESULT: ESCALATE` are handled as above; after a raised tier, continue with that
   tier's steps. There is no second challenge round and no veto. Record the verdict (also a clean
   `NO OBJECTIONS`) and the Lead's answer in `log.md`.
3. **Plan security review** (`security` tier only). Launch `squad-security` in mode `plan`. On
   `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, launch `squad-lead` in mode `revise` and repeat. After the **2nd** rejection launch
   `squad-lead` in mode `decide` (scope down, split into issues, abort, escalate, or — for a pure wording defect — accept and fix it followed by exactly one `squad-security` delta confirmation).
4. **Skeleton** (only if the plan adds or changes API; not applicable when the plan declares the change free of
   production and test code — see *Changes without production or test code* in `.squad/routing.md`, which also
   skips step 5 and the *Coverage gate* in step 6 and requires the plan's *Verification without tests* section;
   log the skipped steps and run the verification named there instead). Launch `squad-dev` in mode `skeleton`: the planned
   signatures built as *Skeleton* in `.squad/stack.md` describes (bodies fail when called), plus the existing
   test call sites the plan assigns to the Dev for an incompatible signature change, so the tests of step 5
   compile.
5. **Tests first** (skipped for `trivial`). Launch `squad-tester` in mode `tests-first`. Confirm yourself
   that the new tests compile and fail on the current code (unless the Tester justified why one cannot).
   A fix without a reproducing test is only acceptable when the bug genuinely needs a live external
   system — then the PR says so.
6. **Implement and cover.** (A plan whose acceptance criteria can be verified only in CI says so, names the
   owner of each such criterion and expects the CI loop of step 11.) For a change without production or test code this is the Dev's edits alone: no
   `squad-tester`, no *Test with coverage*, no *Coverage gate*. Launch `squad-dev` in mode `implement` with the plan and the test names; it
   also makes the documentation updates the plan lists and may adapt a test call site that no longer
   compiles only because of a signature or field change it made itself (`.squad/routing.md`, *Loop limits*). If the Dev disputes a test, launch `squad-lead`
   in mode `decide`; the Tester changes a test only if the Lead says so. Then run *Test with coverage* and
   the *Coverage gate* yourself (both in `.squad/stack.md`). Launch `squad-tester` in mode `coverage` only
   when the gate fails or the Dev reports uncovered new lines; if the gate already passes and the only
   uncovered lines are accepted gaps, skip the pass and log why in `log.md`. Repeat Dev/Tester until the gate passes. Lines reported as not unit-testable go to
   `squad-lead` in mode `decide`; an accepted gap is recorded in `log.md`.
7. **Code check.** Run the gates yourself first, with the commands from `.squad/stack.md`: *Format check*,
   the *Analyzer gate* (no diagnostic of any severity in a changed file), *Test*, the *Coverage gate* (not
   for a change without production or test code) and `python3 .squad/tools/scope-check.py`. Keep the output:
   the reviewers get it in step 8. If everything passes, step 7 is done without launching anyone. Otherwise
   launch `squad-code-officer` with the base ref — the only member that runs the formatter and clears
   analyzer diagnostics; structural items it hands back go to `squad-dev` (or `squad-tester`), a scope
   finding to its owner — and run the gates again until they pass. This is the gate before the PR; CI is not
   meant to find anything here.
8. **Review.** Launch `squad-reviewer` (round 1, full) and — for `security` only —
   `squad-security` in mode `diff`, in parallel, against the base ref. Pass them the work folder
   (`specs/<folder>/`) so they check the plan's acceptance criteria and tier (tier `docs`: the first
   `log.md` row, since there is no `plan.md`) and the gate output of step 7 for this head, so they do not
   build and test again; either may raise the tier. Tier `docs`: you fix a blocking finding yourself, run
   the two checks again, then a delta round, then step 10. Blocking findings → their owner fixes them (`squad-dev` for production code, `squad-tester` for tests) → steps 6
   (coverage) and 7 again → **a new review round on the delta is mandatory** before step 9; never go from
   a blocking finding straight to PR approval. The same holds for a non-blocking finding the Lead decides
   to fix now: any change to production code, tests or `docs/` after a review round needs a delta round. A
   wording-only fix to a `Proposed` record, applied verbatim as a reviewer proposed it, rides the next delta
   round when one is due anyway; when none is due, it gets its own delta round by the member that proposed
   it. At most **2 fix rounds** after round 1; then `squad-lead`
   in mode `decide`. Pass each reviewer the exact commit SHA to review, and do not commit to the work branch
   (log rows included) between launching a round and receiving its report; a reviewer reports the SHA it
   reviewed first, and a report for another head is a stale round. A reviewer or security subagent that stops
   on an API error (for example `529 Overloaded`, or `429` for a rate limit — relaunch it once the limit has
   reset) is relaunched unchanged, at most twice; after that report a blocker to the user. Non-blocking findings are collected for step 9.
9. **PR approval.** First run the checklist yourself (`.squad/routing.md`, step 9): the latest review round
   is clean and nothing but `specs/` bookkeeping changed since it ran; the gates of step 7 pass on this head;
   the area documents and documentation updates the plan names are in the diff. Then set each `Proposed`
   decision record of this change and its index row in `docs/decisions/README.md` (the Lead added it with
   the record) to `Accepted` and run `python3 .squad/tools/decision-check.py` (bookkeeping, like `log.md`). Launch `squad-lead` in mode
   `approve-pr` — with the base ref, the gate output, the review outcome and the open points — only when a
   decision is open: a plan deviation in a member's report, a Lead decision recorded during steps 3–8, a
   non-blocking finding not yet decided (fix now, or you open a linked GitHub issue now), or a change to
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `.squad/project.md`. Otherwise log "approved by checklist" and continue. A fix
   the Lead orders goes back to step 6 or 8 (counting against the review loop limit); `NOT APPROVED` without
   a fix means the Lead decides or escalates. After the PR (step 11) a re-approval is asked only once CI on
   the new head has finished and passes, with the finished check-run list attached.
10. **Pull request** (Dev role, performed by you). First move the working record off the branch: post
    `plan.md` (none for tier `docs`) and `log.md` as one comment on the issue (each inside a collapsed `<details>` block, headed
    "Squad working record"). When `plan.md` is so long that re-typing it through a tool call is impractical,
    post a permalink to the last commit that contains it (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<sha>/specs/issue-<number>/plan.md`)
    plus a summary of the tier, acceptance criteria, decisions and challenge outcome instead; that commit
    stays reachable through the PR's history. Then `git rm -r specs/issue-<number>/`, confirm with
    `python3 .squad/tools/scope-check.py --no-specs`, commit ("Remove squad working record"), and push. Later
    log rows (steps 11–12) are appended by editing that comment. Then open the PR from
    [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../../../.github/pull_request_template.md): title per
    `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — `[area] Description`, where `area` is one of the areas
    CONTRIBUTING lists, capitalized — not a lowercase class or file name. It becomes the squash
    commit subject on `main`. Body describing the bug, the fix and the
    reproducing test, `Closes #<number>` under Issues, links to the decision records. Next Steps lists
    **only linked GitHub issues** (create them now) or "None" — never an unlinked "revisit later". Follow the `create-pr` skill's template rules, but
    do **not** run its internal review loop — step 8 replaced it. If the fix is not fully verifiable
    without a real external system, say so.
11. **After the PR.** Subscribe to the PR's activity right after opening it (`subscribe_pr_activity` when
    available; otherwise check the CI and code-analysis (e.g. SonarQube Cloud) results yourself before finishing) — a session
    that ends with an unwatched PR has not completed this step. Stay with the PR until CI is green and the
    code-analysis quality gate (e.g. SonarQube Cloud) passes:
    - code-analysis findings → `squad-code-officer` (structural ones → `squad-dev`);
    - failing build or tests → `squad-dev` (test defects → `squad-tester`);
    - review comments (human, automated, `review-pr`) → `squad-dev`, worked in this PR, blocking or not.

    Each fix goes through steps 7–8 again (delta review; `scope-check.py --no-specs` from now on), with at
    most 2 fix rounds per failure before the Lead decides. A re-approval (step 9) runs the same checklist once
    CI on the new head has finished and passes. When the plan's acceptance criteria can only be verified in CI
    (for example a container image the sandbox cannot build), a red CI on exactly those criteria is a normal
    outcome of this step: the plan names the owner (Dev for Dockerfile, compose and workflow files), and every
    fix gets a delta review round. The work folder is gone by now: give the Reviewer, Security and the Lead the plan (tier
    `docs`: the first log row; features:
    also `spec.md` and `tasks.md`) from the "Squad working record" comment, or via
    `git show <commit-before-removal>:specs/<folder>/<file>`, and record each log row by editing that
    comment. Edit a restored working record in one batch: interim commits that a stop hook demands while it
    is half edited each re-trigger the code analysis on the open PR. Never skip, disable or weaken a test to
    get green.
12. **Wrap-up (mandatory).** Collect what this run taught about the squad itself (a rule that was
    unclear or contradictory, a tool that misbehaved, an agent that could not be launched, a step that
    had to be improvised), each with the role it concerns and a concrete proposal, and file them as
    `.squad/routing.md`, *Squad lessons*, says: lessons about template-managed files as **one** issue
    labelled `squad` in the template repository named in `.squad/template.json` (a general lesson belongs there, never in this
    repository: attach that repository to the session first if needed, with the access to create the issue;
    only if attaching is refused, file it here with the label `squad-upstream`), lessons about project knowledge
    as **one** issue labelled `squad` in this repository (create the labels if missing). Link the issues
    from the working record comment. Do **not** edit `.squad/`, `.claude/` or the instruction files.
    Then run `python3 .squad/tools/squad-log.py issue-<number> --summary` on the log (restore it from the
    working record comment if the folder is gone) and append the table to the working record comment under
    a "Squad run metrics" heading: launches, tokens, tool uses and seconds per role are what tunes the
    squad's models and effort over time.
    Report the branch, the PR URL, the tier, the `squad` issues (or "no lessons"), the metrics table and any
    escalation or Lead decision to the user. If there is genuinely nothing to learn,
    append a `| <date> | 12 Wrap-up | Orchestrator | no lessons |` row to the working record comment
    instead of opening an issue — the step itself is never skipped.

## What the pull request says — and what it doesn't

The PR title and description document the change, not how it was produced: the bug, the fix and the test
that pins it down. Plan revisions, review rounds and their findings never appear there.
(The working record is the "Squad working record" comment on the issue; the lasting reasoning is in
`docs/decisions/`.)

## Notes

- Prefer non-interactive commands only. If push or PR creation fails, stop and report it.
- Never close the issue manually; `Closes #<number>` closes it on merge.
