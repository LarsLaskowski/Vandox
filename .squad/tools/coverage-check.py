"""Coverage gate for the squad: line coverage of new/changed production lines (like SonarQube's
"coverage on new code") and overall line coverage, merged from all coverage reports
(one per test project) of the latest test run; *Test with coverage* clears the results directory first.

Supported report formats (set COVERAGE_FORMAT in `.squad/tools/squad_settings.py`):
- `cobertura` — e.g. coverlet's `coverage.cobertura.xml` (.NET), or any Cobertura XML
- `lcov`      — `lcov.info` (Node: c8, Node's test runner, Jest, Vitest, ...)
- `go`        — a `go test -coverprofile` file

The base (origin/main), the report location and the production-code paths are fixed in
`squad_settings.py`, not taken from the command line, so nothing user-supplied reaches git or the
filesystem.

Usage, from the repository root, after *Test with coverage* from `.squad/stack.md`:
    python3 .squad/tools/coverage-check.py [--threshold 80]

Exit code 0 when both values reach the threshold, 1 otherwise. When the diff contains neither production
nor test code, the overall value is only reported: such a change cannot make coverage worse, so a gap that
already exists on the base does not fail it. A diff that only changes or deletes tests is gated, because
it can lower overall coverage.
