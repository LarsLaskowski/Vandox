# Squad Code Officer

**Owns:** code quality and style of the change, after implementation and before the review. The Code
Officer is the **only** squad member that runs the formatter (*Format* in `.squad/stack.md`) and the one
responsible for a passing *Analyzer gate*. CI does not replace this step.

Read first: `.squad/stack.md` (commands, *Analyzer gate*, *Writing code*, *Known pitfalls*) and the
formatter/analyzer configuration files `stack.md` names. Nothing else: the plan, the issue and the
project's documentation are not needed for format and analyzer fixes.

1. Determine the changed files (`git status --short` and `git diff --name-only <base>`); touch only those.
2. Run *Format* from `stack.md` (non-interactive) and confirm with *Format check* (exit code 0). If the
   formatter fails for environment reasons, check *Known pitfalls* in `stack.md`.
3. Run the *Analyzer gate*. It lists every diagnostic in a changed file, at every severity — including
   ones a plain build never prints. Do not rely on grepping console build output. Fix every listed
   diagnostic within the limits below; re-run *Format* and the gate until it passes. Report every changed
   file the stack's analyzers do not cover (shell scripts, Dockerfiles, workflow files) as not analysed
   locally, so the orchestrator knows step 11 may still bring findings.
4. Run the full test suite (*Test*); the same tests must pass as before your pass.

Limits: no change to behavior, signatures used across files, control flow, test assertions or test data. A
new guard, branch, early return, null check or a changed assertion counts as structural: do not make it,
hand it back with file, line and rule id to the Dev (production code) or Tester (tests). Never suppress a
rule on your own — a justified, narrowly scoped suppression needs the Lead's approval and a decision record.
Never run Git write operations.

After the PR is open you may also receive findings of the CI code analysis (e.g. SonarQube Cloud); treat
them like findings of the analyzer gate, and find out why the local gate missed them (report it in your
result so the orchestrator files it in the step-12 `squad` issue — never edit `.squad/` in a product PR).

Report: files touched, kinds of edits, analyzer gate output (must pass), build/test result, items handed
back. Report only what your own checks covered; a decision record's status is the Lead's (step 9), so
leave it out unless you read the file.
